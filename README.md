### System Design Documentation

#### Overview
This system, based on client-server architecture, facilitates authenticated interactions between clients and servers in a network environment. The system comprises a Time Server for time synchronization, an Authentication and Ticket Server for securing communications, and an interface for managing server and client keys.

#### Time Server Design
1. **Server Implementation**:
   - A server is established to handle incoming connections, specifically designed to cater to multiple clients concurrently.
   - Clients are enabled to connect and request the current server time.
   - The server maintains the capability to service multiple clients simultaneously.

2. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Accurate and synchronized time information is provided to all connected clients.
   - The server ensures that the time data shared is consistent and precise.

3. **Error Management**:
   - Mechanisms are in place to handle invalid requests or connection errors, ensuring the server's stability and reliability.

#### Authentication and Ticket Server
1. **User Authentication**:
   - A robust user authentication system is implemented, validating the identities of clients.
   - On successful authentication, secure tickets are issued to clients, which are used for authorized network communications.

2. **Ticket Validation and Encryption**:
   - A process for validating tickets on the server side is established to verify the authenticity of client requests.
   - Encryption techniques are employed to safeguard client-server communications and protect the integrity of the authentication process.

3. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Security-related events and activities are logged meticulously.
   - Comprehensive error handling strategies are adopted to address security lapses or breaches.

#### Server and Client Key Update Interface
1. **Interface Development**:
   - An interface, either graphical or command-line based, is developed for the purpose of updating server and client keys.
   - This interface is accessible to administrators for updating server keys and clients for their respective keys.

2. **Secure Key Update Mechanism**:
   - The system ensures that the key updating process is secure and seamless.
   - Validation checks are incorporated to permit only authorized personnel to execute key updates.

3. **Logging and Notifications**:
   - All activities related to key updates are logged for future reference and accountability.
   - Notifications are set up to inform relevant parties about key update events.

#### General Security Measures
1. **Encrypted Communications**:
   - All transmissions, particularly sensitive data such as user credentials and time information, are encrypted.

2. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - The use of JWT tokens enhances the security of server requests, ensuring that communications are authenticated.

3. **Robust Key Management**:
   - Key management is handled securely, with provisions for key rotation and retrieval to maintain system integrity.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - The system is equipped with comprehensive error handling to address issues in data processing and network communication.
   - Logging mechanisms are in place for monitoring and auditing purposes.
